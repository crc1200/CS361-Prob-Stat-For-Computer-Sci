# CS 361 - Final Project
Contains the starter code for parts 1 and 2 of the CS 361 final project.

## Instructions
There are 2 options to run the code: 

+ use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) online (highly recommended option)
+ run each Python notebook locally with Anaconda or some other Python notebook application

If you've never used Anaconda before or don't know how to run Python notebooks locally, you can use Google Colab. It's a free online coding environment made by Google that lets you run Python notebooks. The files will be saved to Google Drive. To upload the files:

### Google Colab - Upload by clicking the Upload button
1. Either do `git clone https://github.com/cs361-illinois/final-project` or download the files locally.
2. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and sign in on any Google account. 
3. Whether you cloned the repository or downloaded the files locally, you can click `Upload` to upload each `.ipynb` file one by one. 

### Google Colab - Upload through GitHub URL
1. You can go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and click `GitHub`. Then enter `https://github.com/cs361-illinois/final-project` as the URL. Then there should be 2 options for `.ipynb` files to upload. Click on both of these links to upload them to Google Colab.
2. **IMPORTANT:** You **MUST** save each notebook by either going to `File -> Save a copy in Drive` or doing Ctrl-S and then clicking `Save a copy in Drive`. Otherwise, the file will not be saved in your Google Drive and you will lose all your work once you exit the page.
